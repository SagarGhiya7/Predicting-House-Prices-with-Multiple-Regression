# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Multiple-Regression

The goal of the assignment is to determine which features play a critical role and then predicting the house price with those features. The first challenge was to remove outliers as they could possibly hamper our analysis. Determined features that had data points 3 standard deviations away from the mean. Used scatter plot to figure out if they needed to be removed and then removed them.

Performed stepwise backward elimination to remove insignificant features. Used AIC as a measure of significance. Finally predicted house prices using multiple linear regression mode. Also calculated 95% confidence intervals for house prices. 

Another goal was to determine how the prices were affected with the presence of UFFI variable. Calculated prices with and without UFFI to determine how the house prices dropped with presence of harmful substance UFFI.
